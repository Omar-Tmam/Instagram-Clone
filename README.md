# ðŸ“¸ Instagram Clone (Flutter, MVVM, Responsive)

A simple Instagram clone built with **Flutter** using the **MVVM architecture pattern** and **responsive design principles**.  
This project is meant as a starting point to practice clean architecture and create a scalable foundation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of concerns between Model, View, and ViewModel.  
- **Responsive UI**: Works on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, web).  
- **State Management**: Easy-to-maintain structure with clear responsibilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is **not** to replicate the entire Instagram app,  
but to provide a **basic Instagram-like clone** with:
- Solid structure  
- Responsive UI  
- MVVM pattern  

to make further development easier.
